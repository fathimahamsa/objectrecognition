# Red Color Detection using OpenCV

This project detects the color red in real-time using your webcam.  
It converts the video feed to HSV color space and applies a mask to highlight red areas.

### How it works
- Captures video from the webcam.
- Converts each frame to HSV.
- Applies a red color range mask.
- Displays both the original and the red-highlighted output.

### Run the script
